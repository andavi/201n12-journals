# Day 6 - Finding Time

What motivates me to find time during my busy schedule is knowing that I have to make time if I am going to be able to change my situation. Knowing that I don't want to go back to the jobs I have had in the past is the biggest motivator. And the best way to ensure that I don't is finding the time now to gain developer skills towards a new career.
