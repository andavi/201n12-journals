# Day 8

Today we learned more about appending HTML with JavaScript, as well as creating tables, and JS events. I feel pretty good about most of the coding so far. I will be going to the Partner Power Hour on Friday to work on the networking side of things.

On the side I still want to work on learning algorithms for technical interviews, however I've been tempted to start reading *Eloquent JavaScript* in order to get deep understanding of the language. Not sure if I'll be able to both of those things in addition to class. Time will tell.
