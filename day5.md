# Day 5 - The Why's

It is important as an adult learner to know why you are learning something. This is true as it results to the larger - as in why am I doing web development - and the smaller - as in why do we use git - why. 

## Large Why

I want a better life for myself, i.e. the opportunity to better my situation, progress in a career, and have autonomy and control in my life.

## Small Why

Git and Github are version control tools used to track progress, revert changes, and work collaboratively on projects. Used correctly, they can be enormously useful and even indispensable. Used incorrectly and they become the bane of one's existence.
