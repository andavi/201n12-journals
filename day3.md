# Day 3

Today we learned about boxes in CSS, loops, and conditionals. In the discussion of the conditionals, we had a complex condition that reminded me of DeMorgan's law:

`!x && !y === !(x || y)`
`!x || !y === !(x && y)`

Assuming x and y are booleans, these should both evaluate to true.

## I did not know there was a prompt so I will write about that below

For me the experiences that will motivate me to continue learning are the jobs I've held in the past. I've had a lot of unskilled manual labor jobs that don't pay well. Working construction in the summer in Florida really makes me appreciate the idea of working in an air conditioned office while sipping a frappuccino. Grueling work for little pay isn't fun for anyone, and I'm grateful to have the ability to move on from that.
