# Day 14

Today we did some team building exercises where we talked about good teams we've been a part of and some bad ones. I talked about the Navy as bad and some in college that were good. We also did some exercises with our group talking about individual strengths and weaknesses. After it was over my team discussed a basic idea for our project and what it might look like.
